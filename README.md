# Test Web Page – Japanese Traditional System Style

This repository contains a simple static web page built with **React** and **Vite**. It is designed to mimic the look and feel of classic Japanese insurance system interfaces (e.g., Visual Basic .NET era), serving as a test/demo for such legacy UI styling.

## Features
- Legacy‑style form layout driven by `public/form_config.json`.
- Modern development workflow (Vite dev server, hot‑module replacement).
- GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages.

## How to Run Locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

## Deployment
The project is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via the workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
